Warnings:
This tool is for educational use only and should not be used for creating passwords as it is prone to breaching.

This tool can be misused if its used simply as it is. There are no protocols or catches to determing if the strength of the password is truly strong. This simple script is subjective in the way how strong a password really is. If this were to be used, please implement tests to verify results. Someone could modify this to lie to another user about the strength of their password and misinform.
